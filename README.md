# Personal Portfolio
> Front-end

This is the Front-end of my personal portfolio app. In this application I use
the following technologies:

- React - Redux
- Flow
- Compiled using `create-react-app`
    - Webpack - sass and a lot more

## Project state

This project is still under development, but I could consider this stage to be
a kind of an *open beta* (early release xP). And yet are still some things to do:

- [ ] Change hero picture
- [ ] Add more natural feeling animations
- [ ] Improve performance of behavior, elements appearing when scrolling.

## Disclaimer

If you want to use parts of the code of this application you can use it freely.
Although I don't authorize the usage of assets containing my image, in other
words, pictures of myself I have in the repo. Apart from that, feel free to get
inspired by my way of writing code and designing, if you want to contact me, you
can do it at [contact@friasdesign.com](mailto:contact@friasdesign.com)
