                COMPUTER GEEK

            One may think that I would have become a developer rightaway, but eventually I started my college days as Musical Arts Student, and became a lover of Romantic piano composers like Franz Listz and Frederic Chopin. After experimenting with Jazz Piano, I played with a Jazz Quartet and on my own, until I later discovered that music, although my passion, wasn\'t something I wanted to live of.

            After a couple of years of experimenting, I went back to my roots and started studying

            In the present day, I want to focus all my time to

                              One may think that I would have become a developer rightaway, but eventually I started my college days as Musical Arts Student, and became a lover of Romantic piano composers like Franz Listz and Frederic Chopin. After experimenting with Jazz Piano, I played with a Jazz Quartet and on my own, until I later discovered that music, although my passion, wasn\'t something I wanted to live of.
